# What is Frappuccino? #

Frappuccino is a library and framework written in F# that implements FRP (functional reactive programming) on .Net. It allows the creation of seemingly imperative applications such as games, and UI in declarative style.


# Benefits #
  * More succinct
  * Less code to do very complex things
  * Makes timers (e. g. Explosion blast timers) in game development easier because it uses Rx
  * Takes less time to figure out what the code does
  * Based on .Net allows the use of existing .net libraries
  * Can use any .Net language that supports LINQ
  * Built on top of Rx so you can use existing Rx code
# Use Cases #
  * Game devlopment
  * GUI development
  * Anything else involving events and values that change over time
